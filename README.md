# DLORE-DP
The matlab code and synthetic data sets for Dense Members of Local Cores-based Density Peaks Clustering Algorithm
DLORE_DP.m includes DLORE-DP algorithm (Algorithm 4 of the manuscript), CoreSearch_supk.m includes Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3. DP.m is used to cluster local cores. drawcluster2 is used to draw the clustering result. SNNDPC2.m includes the SNN-DPC algorithm we compared in the experiment. Synthetic data sets pacake includes the synthetic data sets we used in the experiment
